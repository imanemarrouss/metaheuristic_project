# **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) with Simulated Annealing (SA) for Perplexity Minimization**

## **Overview**

Welcome to the project where **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)** and **Simulated Annealing (SA)** are combined to minimize perplexity in a sequence generation task. The main objective is to rearrange scrambled words in holiday-themed stories to minimize perplexity, which is a metric used to evaluate how well a language model predicts a sequence. This hybrid algorithm searches for optimal word sequences that make the Christmas tales coherent again.

This project is designed to solve the **Santa 2024 - The Perplexity Permutation Puzzle**, where the challenge is to reorder scrambled words from various Christmas stories and minimize perplexity for better story coherence.

## **Features**

### 1. **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO):**
   - Simulates the behavior of ants searching for the best path through a search space.
   - Each ant explores different possible sequences of words and updates pheromones on successful paths to guide future ants toward better solutions.
   - This approach is particularly useful for large search spaces where multiple permutations need to be explored.

### 2. **Simulated Annealing (SA):**
   - A local search technique that refines solutions found by ACO.
   - SA allows the algorithm to escape local minima by probabilistically accepting worse solutions early on, and gradually focusing on improving the solution as iterations proceed, akin to cooling down a material in physics.
   - This technique helps in finding global solutions by avoiding getting stuck in local optima.

### 3. **Perplexity Evaluation:**
   - The **perplexity score** is used as the primary evaluation metric. Lower perplexity indicates that the generated sequence is more coherent and accurately predicted by the language model.
   - Each sequence generated by the ants is evaluated using the `scorer.get_perplexity()` method, which calculates how well the sequence aligns with the **Gemma 2 9B** model's predictions.
